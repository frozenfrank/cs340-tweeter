## Mermaid

These files heavily leverage the [mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) language features built in to GitHub.\
[The docs](https://mermaid.js.org/intro/) give good examples of ways to use the syntax.

Printing the diagrams can be achieved by copying the source syntax
into the [mermaid.live](https://mermaid.live/edit) editor, and clicking 
the "view fullscreen" button. On this page, the browser print command
does a great job converting the diagram into a PDF.
